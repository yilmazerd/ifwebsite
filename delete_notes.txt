How to use instant function:

Let's start with a simple example, let's say you are generating a function to mock an api response and your response is in the form of

{
	"UserId":"12",
	"UserName":"Tom",
	"UserLastName":"Jerry"
}

Step 1: Create the code

In order to make this happen with instantfunction, we need need to simply write this response into standard output in the programming language of your choice. As the following:

Java:



Python:


You can test this code in your local environment before submitting.

Step 2: Create your function
Simply copy paste the example code in to create your function page. You'll get a unique ID once you submit your code. With that uniqueid you can call your function. 

Step 3: Add delay and response code (Optional)
You can add some delay or a response code to your function as a query parameter.
